# Express.js Server Response Delay Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where server responses are significantly delayed, particularly when asynchronous operations are involved. The delay is caused by improper handling of asynchronous tasks, leading to performance issues and poor user experience.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that simulates an asynchronous operation with a 5-second delay before sending a response. This delay is noticeable and can significantly degrade the application's responsiveness.  The problem arises because the asynchronous operation is not properly managed, causing the server to appear unresponsive.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to the problem.  It demonstrates a correct way of handling asynchronous tasks in Express.js to prevent response delays.
